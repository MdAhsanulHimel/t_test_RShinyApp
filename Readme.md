# T-Test Shiny App

This repository contains the source code for a Shiny app that provides a flexible interface for performing t-tests. The app is hosted on the ShinyApps.io platform and can be accessed at [https://ahsanul.shinyapps.io/t_test/](https://ahsanul.shinyapps.io/t_test/).

The app includes two main components:

1. **app.R**: This file contains the code for the Shiny app's user interface and server logic.
2. **t_test_flex.R**: This file contains a custom R function, `t_test_flex`, which provides a flexible interface for performing t-tests. The function takes in a variety of arguments, including the type of t-test to perform, the significance level, and the data to be tested.
